# Welcome to [**`pyppbox`**](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox) !

## üêçüì¶ [**`pyppbox`**](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox) = Python + People + Toolbox 

* Yes, **`pyppbox`** is an open-source Python toolbox which was originally made for the PoseTReID framework. 
* This toolbox features 3 main modules: People Detection module, People Tracking module, and People Re-identifying module. These modules support a bunch of well-known people detectors, trackers, and re-identificators which can be used separately or put together with only a few lines of code. 
* **`pyppbox`** also supports real-time online and offline evaluation on [PoseTReID datasets](https://github.com/rathaumons/PoseTReID_DATASET).
* The initial version of **`pyppbox`** is also intergrated with GUI for easy demo and config. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR VERSION 2 (May 15, 2023)
* üÜï **Integrate the [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/rathaumons/ultralytics-for-pyppbox) in `pyppbox`!**
* **Check more important releases/commits here [RELEASENOTES.md](RELEASENOTES.md).**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* You must install all requirements before you are able to build.
* Please check the [README.md](requirements/README.md) in [requirements](requirements).

## üöÄ Setup `pyppbox`

### Option 1: Use the [prebuilt WHL (Lite) for V2 here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TsxFA_d6TqzM-rXNkLi0IxCCezVzJf4y) 
* `pip install pyppbox-xxx.whl`

### Option 2: Build your own `pyppbox`
* Download the extra models & weights [Lite for V2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tL6w-RfF_NlIWNlSmuzD0VhEQA9M9h11) or [Full for V2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11Tm7dMafajtpNzQUa-jWcK_CkHPSDxWf) and extract to the root [`pyppbox`](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox/)
* Create WHL by running `creat_whl.cmd`
* Install newly created WHL `pip install pyppbox-xxx.whl`

### Quick Test
* On your terminal or CMD:
```
python
import pyppbox
pyppbox.launchGUI()
```
* Now you should see [the GUI of pyppbox for easy demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rathaROG/screenshot/master/pyppbox/pyppbox_launchGUI_main.png). Just hit the "LAUNCH" button!
